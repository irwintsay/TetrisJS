Tetris Game

Initialize Tetris game space. 20 x 10 grid pattern represented in HTML by a
20 x 10 set of Divs

Define nested array for representing Tetris game space

Define all possible Tetromino pieces with coordinates representing shape and
pattern

Define the current Tetromino piece, the piece currently in play, as an array of
coordinates representing its shape and pattern

Randomly select a Tetromino piece and assign to "current piece"

Define collision detection: Collision is true if there are blocks below the
"current piece" or next to the "current piece".

Define the Tetris game-state:

    Generate a new, random Tetromino piece and assign to current piece

    Drop current piece at a rate of 1 unit per 500ms

    Use event handler to check for player input:
        Left arrow key: move current piece 1 unit to the left
        Right arrow key: move current piece 1 unit to the right
        Down arrow key: move current piece 1 unit down
        Up arrow key: rotate current piece 90 degrees
        Space key: drop piece to the lowest point until collision is detected

    Check for collision to the left, right and below:
        If collision is detected on either side, do not allow player to move
        current piece further in that direction

        If collision is detected below the current piece, leave the piece there,
        evaluate any cleared lines, generate a new random Tetromino piece and
        assign it to the "current piece"

    Check for and evaluate any completed rows:
        Rows that are 100% filled by blocks have to be deleted and everything
        above it must be shifted down by 1 row
        Record number of cleared lines

    Check for losing condition:
        If current tetromino piece falls and stops "out of bounds", or in other
        words, above the playable Tetris game space, evaluate to losing
        condition

    If losing condition has not been met, loop back to first step of Tetris
    game-state: 1. Generate a new, random Tetromino piece and assign to current
    piece.
