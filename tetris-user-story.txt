I see falling puzzle pieces stacking on top of each other. I can control the
puzzle pieces as they fall, moving them left, right, and down. I can also
control their orientation by rotating them. If I fit the pieces together to make
solid rows, I can clear the rows to create more space. My game ends when too
many puzzle pieces have stacked onto each other and there is no longer any room
for a new puzzle piece.
