User Story

As the user, I control puzzle pieces as they fall, moving them left, right, and down. I can also control their orientation by rotating them. If I fit the pieces together to make solid, complete rows, the rows are deleted to create more space. My game ends when too many puzzle pieces have stacked onto each other and there is no room for a new puzzle piece.
